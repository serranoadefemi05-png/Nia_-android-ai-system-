Dedicated threads will be created AUTOMATICALLY on every channel that has been paired (WhatsApp always, plus Telegram / Discord / Slack when a container has been paired via /pairforum, /pairserver, or /yabbypair). PROJECT: for agents linked to a specific project. You can pass the project NAME or its ID, or omit to create a standalone agent. BEST PRACTICE: Use a HUMAN FIRST NAME for the name (e.g. Marie, Lucas, Sophie, Karim) rather than a project name or technical term. IMPORTANT: Call list_agents first to see which names are already taken, since agent names must be globally unique.\n\n⚠️ POST-CREATION WORKFLOW:\nWhen a STANDALONE agent is created, the response includes:\n  - `whatsappThread`: { groupId, groupName } if WhatsApp is connected\n  - `channelThreads`: array of { channel, thread_id, name, message } for any other paired channel (telegram / discord / slack)\n  - `message`: a pre-built one-line summary like 'Dedicated thread(s) created automatically: WhatsApp: \"💬 Crypto Analyst\", telegram: yabby_a3f9c1b2.'\n\nYou MUST relay the `message` field verbatim (or paraphrase it lightly in the user's language) so the user knows where to find their new agent. Example: if WhatsApp + Telegram threads were created, tell them about BOTH — do not pretend only WhatsApp exists.\n\nNO THREAD CREATED CASES:\n  - WhatsApp adapter not running → no whatsappThread; mention the agent is reachable via the web chat instead.\n  - No paired containers for Telegram/Discord/Slack → no channelThreads on those; tell the user how to pair if they want one (\"To get a dedicated Telegram topic, create a forum group, add me, and run /pairforum\").\n\nEXACT EXAMPLE:\nUser (from Telegram): \"Create agent Bitcoin crypto analyst\"\nYabby: [calls assign_agent]\n→ Receives: { id: \"abc-123\", name: \"Bitcoin\", whatsappThread: { groupName: \"💬 Crypto Analyst\" }, channelThreads: [{ channel: \"telegram\", name: \"yabby_a3f9c1b2\" }], message: \"Agent Bitcoin created successfully! ✅\\n\\nDedicated thread(s) created automatically: WhatsApp: \\\"💬 Crypto Analyst\\\", telegram: yabby_a3f9c1b2.\" }\nYabby: \"Agent Bitcoin created ✅.

    type: "function", name: "create_agent_thread",
    description: "Create a dedicated discussion thread with an EXISTING agent on a specific channel (whatsapp / telegram / discord / slack).\n\n⚠️ PREREQUISITES:\n- The agent must exist BEFORE (created via assign_agent)\n- You must have received EXPLICIT confirmation from the user (\"yes\", \"ok\", \"go ahead\")\n- The `channel` parameter is REQUIRED. Do NOT guess. If the user did not say which channel, ASK them, or pick from the response's `currently_available` list when this tool returns 'Missing required parameter: channel'.\n\nCHANNEL MECHANICS:\n- whatsapp: Yabby creates a private WhatsApp group (name '💬 [role]') and binds it to the agent. Always available when the WhatsApp adapter is up.\n- telegram: Yabby creates a private FORUM TOPIC inside a paired forum group container (set up once via /pairforum in a Telegram forum group).\n- discord:  Yabby creates a private text CHANNEL inside a paired Discord server (set up once via /pairserver in the server). Channel is invisible to @everyone.\n- slack:    Yabby creates a private CHANNEL inside a paired Slack workspace (set up once via /yabbypair). Owner is invited automatically.\n\nERROR HANDLING:\n- If the channel is missing/invalid, the tool returns { error, currently_available, supported_channels, example } — relay this to the user so they can pick.\n- If the container is not paired, the tool returns an error explaining the pairing slash command — instruct the user to run it.\n\nEFFECT:\n1. Creates the platform thread/topic/channel\n2. Records a single-owner channel_thread_binding so any non-owner who finds the thread is silently rejected + audit-logged\n3. All messages in the thread are routed ONLY to this agent; the agent responds ONLY there\n\nEXPECTED RETURN (success):\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"channel\": \"telegram\",\n  \"thread_id\": \"<chat_id>:<topic_id>\",\n  \"name\": \"yabby_a3f9c1b2\",\n  \"message\": \"Telegram forum topic created.
